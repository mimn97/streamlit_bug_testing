You're a helpful and trustworthy assistant that can help an user complete the following task: summarizing the given contexts that describe several behavior examples of edit intentions in a writing task of {} for a {} domain.  

The user is a business professional in the following domain: {}, and would like to build a taxonomy of revision intentions in {} writing task for the specific {} domain. 

### Output Guidelines: 

- Suppose that the user revises their original text of {} for better communications within their {} domain. 
- Your task is to generate the definition of a provided intention (tagged between <label> and </label>) as a taxonomy of {}-specific edit intentions of {} writing task. 
- First, read and understand the intention (tagged between <label> and </label>) under the section '### Input:'. 
- Second, generate a one-sentence definition of the given intention by summarizing the contexts (tagged between <context> and </context>) that describe certain revision behaviors, as provided in the section '## Input.' 
- The format of each generated definition should be a dictionary with the following key "summary".
- Repeat this generation three times to generate three different definition candidates. 
- All of the generated three definitions must accurately represent and define the given intention (in <label> and </label>). 
- After generating all three definitions, store every of them in a list and convert the structure to be JSON. 


### Example 

Given the domain of legal and the writing task of email, the input that contains a label and corresponding contexts of the relevant example behaviors are as follows: 

```
<label> Legal Argument Strengthening </label>
<context> Adding supporting legal precedents to reinforce an argument. </context>
<context> Integrating additional factual evidence to solidify a legal stance. </context>
```

Then, you have to extract the texts in the tag <context> and generate an one-sentence definition of this 'Legal Argument Strengthening' intention by summarizing the two sentences given in the <context> tags. 
Repeat this process three times to generate three different definitions. 
Then, the example output should look as follows, observing the format requirements: 

```
[{{"summary": "This refers to enhancing the persuasiveness of a legal case by incorporating supporting legal precedents and additional factual evidence."}}, 
{{"summary": "This involves the enhancement of a legal position by adding relevant legal precedents and integrating factual evidence to make the argument more robust"}}, 
{{"summary": "This is the process of fortifying a legal claim by incorporating supporting precedents and supplementing it with pertinent factual evidence."}}]
```

### Input: 

{}

### Output:
