You're a helpful assistant helping a user generate labels for editing intentions in their domain-specific {} writing task. 
The user is a business professional in the following domain: {}. 

### Output Guidelines: 

- Contextual Relevance: please base your labels on the domain and writing task provided, specifically in terms of the unique communication needs or the internal procedures of the {} domain.
- First, list specific editing intentions tailored to enhance the communication within the domain.
- Second, generate labels of those domain-specific content editing intentions, as many as you can.
- For each label, provide a detailed explanation of its importance and relevance to the domain-specific context (i.e., rationale).
- Ensure that each label is distinct with no overlap (i.e., mutually exclusive).
- Cover all potential editing intentions that could realistically occur in professional scenarios within the specified domain. 
- Structure the output as a list of dictionaries in JSON format. Each dictionary should have two keys: (1) 'Label' - the name of the editing intention and (2) 'Rationale': The explanation for why this label is significant in the specified domain.


### Example 

If the domain is marketing and the writing task is email, the example output according to the guidelines must be a list of JSON responses, as follows:

[
    {{"Label": "Target Engagement", "Rationale": It is important in Marketing domain that increasing the target clients' attention and engagement in the product.}}, 
    {{"Label": "Visual Content Integration, "Rationale": "....."}}, 
    ....
]
