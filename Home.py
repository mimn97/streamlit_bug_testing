        <h2> üëâüèª What consists of a taxonomy? </h2>
        <p> There are three layers of a hierarchical taxonomy that you will build with us: </p>
        <ul>
                <li> <b> (1) Label </b>: a concept of your taxonomy that represents the intentions of writing revisions </li>
                <li> <b> (2) Definition </b>: a brief description of the corresponding label that explains the intention </li>
                <li> <b> (3) Example </b>: the corresponding example of the label in the context of the definition </li>
        </ul>
        <p> You will be working on developing these three layers of the taxonomy in the same order. </p>        
        <h2>  üëâüèª What are the pages on the left sidebar? </h2>        
        <p> You will see several pages named 'STEP X' on the left side bar. Each page is developed to generate each layer of the taxonomy with GPT-4. 
            Please click the page of each STEP accordingly.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> STEP 1: You will provide domain-specific information as inputs to GPT-4. </li>
            <li> STEP 2: GPT-4 will generate labels of your taxonomy according to your inputs from STEP 1. Here, you will validate each of the generated labels and select ones that are indeed important and widely used in your domain. </li>
            <li> STEP 3: Based on the selected labels from STEP 2, GPT-4 will generate examples of each selected label. Similarly, you will validate every one of them and choose ones that are indeed important and widely used in your domain. </li>
            <li> STEP 4: Given the selected labels and the corresponding examples, GPT-4 will generate the definition of the label (based on the examples), or you may provide your own definition of the label.</li>
            <li> STEP 5: you will see a visualized taxonomy of writing revisions according to your selection of the generated three layers. </li>
